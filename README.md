# TheWiggler

This is a small Qt / QML / C++  application that moves your mouse to prevent screensavers and auto locking. It is moderately configurable via a QML UI. 

See the <b>releases</b> folder for release binaries.

Currently it builds on both <b>Windows</b> and <b>OSX</b> and releases for both can be found on the release page (I've only tested it on OSX High Sierra 10.13).
